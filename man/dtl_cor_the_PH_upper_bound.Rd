\title{Theoretical upper bound of correlation coefficient between
time-to-event primary endpoint and binary surrogate endpoint}
\usage{
dtl_cor_the_PH_upper_bound(tau_k, pi_ar = 0.5, q, gamma)
}
\arguments{
\item{tau_k}{Equals n/n_k, where n is the number of patients per treatment
arm at the DTL look and n_k is the number of patients in both
selected and control arms at the kth interim analysis.}

\item{pi_ar}{Allocation rate of treatment and control (0.5 by default)}

\item{q}{Response rate under the null}

\item{gamma}{Hazards ratio of responders and non-responders}
}
\value{
Theoretical upper bound of correlation coefficient
}
\description{
Get theoretical upper bound of correlation coefficient
