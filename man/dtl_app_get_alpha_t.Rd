\title{Minimum significance level for the final stage under drop-the-losers
(DTL) design}
\usage{
dtl_app_get_alpha_t(n, N, delta, q_seq, gamma_seq, alpha, fix_rho = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of patients per treatment arm at the DTL look}

\item{N}{Total number of patients in both selected and control arms
at final analysis}

\item{delta}{Least difference to decide superiority of high dose}

\item{q_seq}{A vector of response rates under the null (can be 95\% CI)}

\item{gamma_seq}{A vector of hazards ratios of responders and non-responders
(can be 95\% CI)}

\item{alpha}{A pre-specified FWER}

\item{fix_rho}{Use fixed correlation coefficient or use theoretical upper
bound to get alpha_t. If = NULL, then it uses upper bound;
else if = real number between 0 and 1, then it use such
number as fixed correlation coefficient.}
}
\value{
A list of two data frames for minimum significance level alpha_t and
significance level alpht_s given all combinations of q_seq and gamma_seq.
}
\description{
Get minimum significance level alpha_t (minimum of alpha_s)
for the final analysis considering the ranges of response rate q and
hazard ratio of responders and non-responders gamma given a pre-specified
FWER alpha
